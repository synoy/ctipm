<center><h1>Script Multiple upload files</h1></center>
This is an Ajax script (with PHP and JavaScript) to upload multiple files in the same time, by adding multiple upload boxes in the form.<br />
This script is from <a href="http://www.coursesweb.net/ajax/multiple-upload-files_t" title="Script Multiple upload files">www.coursesweb.net</a><br />
This script can be implemented and used in both HTML and PHP files, but the server must run PHP.<br />
This Upload script uses the Ajax technology, the files are uploaded without opening or reloading the page, so a refresh will not resend any form data to the server.<br />
<h4>Instructions for use:</h4>
 - Copy the files: "<b>uploader.php</b>", and "<b>upload.js</b>" on your server, in the same directory as the file in which you want to add this script.<br />
 - In your file (.html or .php) add the following code (that creates the upload form):
 <pre><b>
&lt;div id=&quot;ifrm&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;form id=&quot;uploadform&quot; action=&quot;uploader.php&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; enctype=&quot;multipart/form-data&quot; target=&quot;uploadframe&quot; onsubmit=&quot;uploading(this); return false&quot;&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot; class=&quot;file_up&quot; name=&quot;file_up[]&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;UPLOAD&quot; id=&quot;sub&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;upload.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;button onclick=&quot;add_upload('uploadform'); return false;&quot;&gt;New upload box&lt;/button&gt;
 </b></pre>
 - Add the following CSS code, in the HEAD section of your HTML document (this makes the input form fields to be displayed one under the other).
 <pre><b>
&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
#uploadform input {
  display:block; 
  margin:3px auto;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
 </b></pre>
 - <b><i>Also, study and test the file "test.html" (it must be run on server).</i></b><br />
 <h4>Details:</h4>
  - The directory in which the files will be uploaded is named "<b>upload</b>" (<i>you can change it in the "uploader.php" file, to "$updir" variable</i>). You must create this folder on the server and set it CHMOD 0777 permissions.<br />
 - To change the extension type allowed for upload, modify the array in "$allowtype" variable.<br />
 - To change the maxim size allowed for the uploaded files, in kilobytes, modify the value of the "$max_size" variable, initially 500 KB (<i>the maxim size allowed for the uploaded files also depends on server settings</i>).<br /><br />
